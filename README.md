<p>This mod crowdsources trade market pricing data and displays detailed item values as tooltips.

![Tooltip example](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/2badc628971fb2857b1deab3298bb37b6946d397.png)

This mod is a fork of the <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/wynnventory">original Wynnventory mod</a>, bringing back their now removed item price tooltips with our own custom API for collecting and retrieving market data.

<blockquote>
<h3>üìù Note:</h3>
As this mod is brand new with our own API, our price database may be incomplete/innacurate. The database will improve over time as players source more pricing data.
</blockquote>

**How it works:**

  Salt Road collects market data while you are browsing the trade market and sends it to our webserver. When you hover over an item in your inventory, it displays a detailed market price guide based on the market data collected by all mod users.

**Features:**
- Maximum, minimum, average, middle 80%, and unidentified item price tooltips
- \*New\* Weighted average price for better accuracy
- Configurable tooltip display settings

**Planned Features:**
- Website for viewing market data
- Display prices based on roll percentage


üö® Salt Road only includes features removed from the original Wynnventory mod. Unlike Wynnventory, this does not track raidpool or lootpool items. **I recommend you use both mods together and support the original Wynnventory team for their hard work.** üö®</p>
